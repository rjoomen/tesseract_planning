# Tesseract vs MoveIt2 TOTG Implementation - Executive Summary

**Analysis Date:** January 17, 2026
**Branch:** `claude/compare-totg-implementations-7XrhU`

> ⚠️ **Review update — 2026-05-11:** Several claims in this document have been
> corrected or strengthened. See **`REVIEW_UPDATE_2026-05.md`** for the canonical
> current state. In particular:
> - The "MoveIt2 line 759 bug" claim below is **wrong**; Tesseract has the same code
>   and it isn't actually a bug.
> - The antiparallel handling is more broken than described here (NaN propagates
>   through the geometry, not just `acos`).
> - Tesseract is exposed to [moveit2#3565](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2/issues/3565) (huge accelerations) — not covered in
>   this document.
> - File paths and namespaces below are stale after the recent repo restructure;
>   actual source is now at `time_parameterization/totg/...` with namespace
>   `tesseract::time_parameterization`.

## Key Findings

### 1. Tesseract Advantages (What Tesseract Does BETTER)

#### A. Superior Numerical Stability

**Division-by-zero protection in `integrateBackward`** (lines 813-819):
```cpp
// Tesseract checks if slopes are equal
bool check_eq_slope = tesseract_common::almostEqualRelativeAndAbs(slope, start_slope, EPS);
if (check_eq_slope)
  intersection_path_pos = start1->path_pos_ + (start2->path_pos_ - start1->path_pos_) / 2.0;
else
  intersection_path_pos = (/*...formula...*/) / (slope - start_slope);
```
**MoveIt2 does NOT have this check** → Can produce NaN/Inf when consecutive steps have equal acceleration.

#### B. Robust Numerical Comparisons

Tesseract uses `almostEqualRelativeAndAbs()` throughout instead of simple epsilon comparisons:
- Line 813: Equal slope detection
- Lines 823-826: Intersection validation
- Line 852: Zero-tangent protection

**Impact:** Better handling of floating-point edge cases, fewer numerical issues.

#### C. Zero Endpoint Velocities (Safe Concatenation)

**Tesseract behavior:**
- Start: velocity = 0, acceleration = 0
- End: velocity = 0, acceleration = 0
- ✅ **Safe for trajectory concatenation**

**MoveIt2 Jazzy behavior:**
- Start/End: Non-zero velocities/accelerations
- ❌ **Causes discontinuities** ([Issue #3014](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2/issues/3014))

#### D. TrajectoryStep NaN Validation

```cpp
// Tesseract validates on construction
TrajectoryStep(double path_pos, double path_vel)
  : path_pos_(path_pos), path_vel_(path_vel)
{
  assert(!std::isnan(path_pos));   // Catches NaN immediately
  assert(!std::isnan(path_vel));
}
```
**MoveIt2 does NOT have this** → NaN can propagate silently.

### 2. ~~MoveIt2 Bug Found~~ — RETRACTED (2026-05-11)

> **This claim was wrong.** Tesseract's current source at lines 758-764 also uses
> `trajectory_.back()` (class member) in the else branch — same as MoveIt2.
> Since `integrateForward` is invoked as `integrateForward(trajectory_, …)`, the
> parameter `trajectory` and the member `trajectory_` reference the same list
> during execution. The stylistic inconsistency is harmless. See
> `REVIEW_UPDATE_2026-05.md` §2.

### 3. Bug Fixes Tesseract Already Has

All critical MoveIt bug fixes are already incorporated in Tesseract:

| Bug | MoveIt PR | Status in Tesseract |
|-----|-----------|---------------------|
| acos NaN segfault | [#1861](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/pull/1861) | ✅ Fixed (line 253) |
| Invalid accelerations | [#1729](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/pull/1729) | ✅ Fixed (lines 676-680) |
| Division by zero (CircularPathSegment) | [#1218](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2/pull/1218) | ⚠️ Partially (only parallel) |
| Single-waypoint trajectories | [#2054](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/pull/2054) | ✅ Fixed (lines 144-154) |
| Undefined behavior (deep copy) | [#2957](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/pull/2957) | N/A (different structure) |

### 4. What Tesseract is Missing

#### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY: Torque Limits Support

**Status:** ❌ Not implemented

**MoveIt Implementation:** [PR #3412](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/pull/3412), [#3427](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/pull/3427) (May 2023)

**What it does:**
1. Apply standard TOTG with velocity/acceleration constraints
2. Run forward dynamics using URDF inertia model
3. Detect torque limit violations at waypoints
4. Iteratively reduce acceleration limits for violated joints
5. Repeat until torque compliant

**Benefits:**
- Respects actual motor torque capabilities
- Prevents motor damage from overcurrent
- Required for heavy payload applications
- More realistic trajectory execution

**Implementation effort:** 🔴 HIGH (requires dynamics engine integration)

---

#### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY: Better Antiparallel Vector Detection

**Status:** ⚠️ Partially implemented

**Related:** [Issue #27](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/27) - "Negative path velocity" error

**Current issue:** Only checks parallel (same direction), not antiparallel (opposite direction)

**Risk:**
- Division by zero when path reverses direction (A→B→A trajectories)
- **Causes Issue [#27](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/27)** - "Error while integrating backward: Negative path velocity"
- Currently masked by dummy joint workaround (lines 156-172)

**Fix:** Add 5 lines of code in `CircularPathSegment` constructor:
```cpp
const double start_dot_end = start_direction.dot(end_direction);

// Check BOTH parallel AND antiparallel
if ((start_direction - end_direction).norm() < 0.000001 ||
    start_dot_end > 0.999999 || start_dot_end < -0.999999)
{
  // Early exit with zero-length segment
  length_ = 0.0;
  // ...
}
```

**Implementation effort:** 🟢 LOW (5-10 lines)

---

#### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Stricter Limit Validation

**Status:** ⚠️ Lenient behavior

**Current:** Logs error, continues execution (line 107)
```cpp
if (velocity_limits.rows() != acceleration_limits.rows())
{
  CONSOLE_BRIDGE_logError("Invalid velocity or acceleration specified...");
  // Continues execution! No return statement
}
```

**MoveIt2:** Returns `false` on invalid limits ([PR #1794](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit2/pull/1794))

**Recommendation:** Add `return false;` to fail fast

**Implementation effort:** 🟢 LOW (1 line)

---

### 5. Features Tesseract Already Has

✅ **Ruckig Trajectory Smoothing** (with jerk limits)
✅ **Configurable Path Tolerance** (`path_tolerance`, `min_angle_change`)
✅ **Polymorphic Design** (multiple time parameterization algorithms)
✅ **Custom Limit Overrides** (via profile `override_limits`)
✅ **Iterative Spline Parameterization** (ISP algorithm)
✅ **Constant TCP Speed Parameterization** (KDL-based)

---

### 6. Known Issue: A→B→A Trajectories (Issue [#27](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/27))

**Status:** ⚠️ Has workaround, not properly fixed

**Issue:** [tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning#27](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/27)
**MoveIt equivalent:** [moveit/moveit#2495](https://github.com/moveit/moveit/issues/2495) (STILL OPEN since 2021)

**Problem:**
```
Error while integrating backward: Negative path velocity
```

Occurs when trajectory returns to or near a previous position (A→B→A pattern).

**Current Workaround (lines 156-172):**
```cpp
// Append a dummy joint with incrementing values (1.0, 2.0, 3.0...)
// Sets dummy joint limits to infinity
// Ensures no duplicate points exist
```

**Root Cause:**
- A→B→A creates near-antiparallel tangent vectors
- Circular blend arc calculation produces invalid segments
- Backward integration fails with negative velocity

**Why Antiparallel Fix Would Solve This:**
1. Antiparallel vectors would be caught in `CircularPathSegment` constructor
2. Would create zero-length segment instead of invalid circular arc
3. No problematic segments → no negative velocity error

**Test Case (currently disabled):**
```cpp
// Line 295 in time_optimal_trajectory_generation_tests.cpp
// TEST(time_optimal_trajectory_generation, test_return_home)
// Deliberately disabled because it fails without workaround
```

**Comparison with MoveIt:**
- ⚠️ MoveIt has same issue
- ⚠️ MoveIt has NO official workaround
- ⚠️ Issue opened Jan 2021, still unresolved

**Impact:**
- 🟡 Common in practice (many tasks return to home)
- 🟡 Workaround adds overhead (extra dimension to every trajectory)
- 🟡 Masks deeper numerical issues

See [ISSUE_27_ANALYSIS.md](ISSUE_27_ANALYSIS.md) for complete details.

### 7. Known Limitation: Per-Waypoint Scaling (Issue [#164](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/164))

**Status:** ℹ️ **DOCUMENTED - Fundamental Algorithmic Limitation**

**Issue:** [tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning#164](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/164)

**The Limitation:**
TOTG only supports **uniform trajectory-wide scaling**, not **per-waypoint** or **per-state** velocity/acceleration scaling.

**What Works:**
```cpp
// Apply same scaling to entire trajectory
TOTG(waypoints, velocity_scaling=0.5, acceleration_scaling=0.5)
// All waypoints move at 50% speed
```

**What Doesn't Work:**
```cpp
// Different scaling per waypoint - NOT SUPPORTED
waypoint[0]: speed = 100%  // Fast
waypoint[1]: speed = 25%   // Slow ← Cannot do this
waypoint[2]: speed = 100%  // Fast
```

**Why It's Impossible:**
- TOTG computes **globally time-optimal** trajectories
- Requires maximum velocity throughout (within limits)
- Post-scaling individual states creates discontinuous trajectories
- Violates acceleration limits during transitions
- **This is fundamental to the algorithm**, not a bug

**Comparison with MoveIt:**
- ⚠️ MoveIt has SAME limitation (by design)
- ✅ This is expected behavior for TOTG algorithm
- ✅ Not a missing feature in Tesseract

**Workarounds:**
1. **Split trajectory** into multiple segments with different scaling
2. **Use ISP algorithm** instead (more flexible, less optimal)
3. **Adjust waypoint density** to naturally create speed variations

See [ISSUE_164_ANALYSIS.md](ISSUE_164_ANALYSIS.md) for complete details and workaround examples.

### 8. Potentially Fixed: Unused Scaling Factors (Issue [#118](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/118))

**Status:** ✅ **APPEARS FIXED - Awaiting Verification**

**Issue:** [tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning#118](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/118)
**Opened:** September 22, 2021
**GitHub Status:** Still open (but likely resolved)

**Original Problem:**
The `max_velocity_scaling_factor` and `max_acceleration_scaling_factor` parameters were present in the profile but **not actually used** when computing trajectories.

**Current Code Status (Lines 168-172):**
```cpp
// Scaling factors ARE being applied!
max_velocity_dummy_appended << (velocity_limits.col(1) * ci_profile->max_velocity_scaling_factor),
    std::numeric_limits<double>::max();

max_acceleration_dummy_appended << (acceleration_limits.col(1) * ci_profile->max_acceleration_scaling_factor),
    std::numeric_limits<double>::max();

// Scaled limits passed to TOTG
totg::Trajectory parameterized(path, max_velocity_dummy_appended, max_acceleration_dummy_appended, 0.001);
```

**Evidence of Fix:**
- ✅ Scaling factors multiply velocity/acceleration limits (lines 168, 171)
- ✅ Scaled limits passed to TOTG algorithm (line 176)
- ✅ Validation ensures factors in valid range [0.0, 1.0] (lines 97-102)
- ✅ Implementation matches MoveIt2's approach

**Why Issue May Still Be Open:**
- ⚠️ Fix was implemented but issue not closed on GitHub
- ⚠️ No explicit PR/commit documenting the fix
- ⚠️ Needs verification testing to confirm behavior

**Recommendation:**
1. Test with various scaling factors (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)
2. Verify trajectory duration scales appropriately
3. Verify limits are respected
4. If tests pass → Close issue [#118](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/118) on GitHub

**Comparison with MoveIt2:**
- ✅ MoveIt2 has same implementation pattern
- ✅ Tesseract behavior matches expected MoveIt2 behavior

**Priority:** 🟢 **LOW** - Code appears correct, just needs verification and issue closure

See [ISSUE_118_ANALYSIS.md](ISSUE_118_ANALYSIS.md) for complete details and test recommendations.

2. **2d4a0e7** - Add endpoint velocity/acceleration behavior analysis
3. **3383b2b** - Add comprehensive analysis of potential missing improvements

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Priority 1: Antiparallel Vector Handling
```cpp
// Test case: A → B → A trajectory
waypoints:
  [0, 0.7, -2.1, 0, -0.25, 0]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  [0, 0.70001, -2.1, 0, -0.25, 0]
```

### Priority 2: Invalid Limits
```cpp
// Test case: Mismatched limit dimensions
velocity_limits: 6x2
acceleration_limits: 4x2  // Different size!
// Should return false, not continue
```

### Priority 3: Endpoint Concatenation
```cpp
// Test case: Two trajectories sharing endpoint
traj1: A → B (ends at B)
traj2: B → C (starts at B)
// Verify: traj1.end.velocity == 0 && traj2.start.velocity == 0
```

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Tesseract | MoveIt2 |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Numerical Stability** | Excellent | Good |
| **Edge Case Handling** | Excellent | Good |
| **Code Correctness** | Good — has its own bugs not in original analysis (see `REVIEW_UPDATE_2026-05.md` §3, §4, §5) | Good — the "line 759 bug" originally listed here is not actually a bug |
| **Feature Completeness** | Very Good | Excellent |
| **Trajectory Safety** | Excellent | Good (endpoint issues) |

**Overall:** Tesseract ≈ MoveIt2 (revised 2026-05-11 — see `REVIEW_UPDATE_2026-05.md`). Tesseract still wins on `integrateBackward` numerical stability, MoveIt2 wins on torque limits and explicit antiparallel handling. The "1 confirmed bug" basis for the prior 8/10 deduction was retracted.

---

## Conclusion

### Bottom Line

**Tesseract's TOTG implementation is production-ready and more robust than MoveIt2** in critical numerical stability areas. The only significant missing feature is torque limits support, which may not be needed for all applications.

### Should You Port MoveIt2 Code?

**NO.** Tesseract's implementation is superior in most ways. Instead:

1. ✅ Keep Tesseract's superior numerical stability
2. ✅ Keep Tesseract's safe endpoint handling
3. ⚠️ Add the 3 small improvements listed above (especially antiparallel fix)
4. ⚠️ Antiparallel fix would **solve Issue [#27](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract_planning/issues/27)** (negative path velocity)
5. ⚠️ Could then **remove dummy joint workaround** (cleaner code)
6. ⚠️ Evaluate if torque limits are needed for your application
7. ❌ Don't port MoveIt2 code wholesale (would be a downgrade)

### For MoveIt2 Users Migrating to Tesseract

**Good news:** Your trajectories will be safer and more stable!

**Things to know:**
- Endpoints always have zero velocity (unlike Jazzy)
- Better numerical stability means fewer edge case failures
- Same configurable parameters (path_tolerance, etc.)
- Ruckig available for jerk limits if needed
